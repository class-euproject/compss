## Introduction

The PyCOMPSs interactive for Supercomputers (pycompss_interactive_sc) provides a tool to use PyCOMPSs within supercomputers interactively with Jupyter.
This tool has been implemented on top of [PyCOMPSs programming model](http://compss.bsc.es), and it is being developed by the [Workflows and Distributed Computing group](https://github.com/bsc-wdc) of the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es/). For more information on which infrastructures and architectures are supported refer to [Availability](#availability).
