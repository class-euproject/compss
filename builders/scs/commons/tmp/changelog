                - New monitoring tool: with new views, as workload and possibility of visualizing information about previous runs
                - Enhanced Tracing mechanism

        * Simplified execution scripts

        * Simplified installation on Supercomputers

Known Limitations:
     * Exceptions raised from tasks are not handled by the master
     * Java tasks must be declared as public
     * Java objects MUST be serializable or, at least, follow the java beans model
     * Support limited to SOAP based services
